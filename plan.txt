Have a document (text or database, as yet to be decided) that will contain all
of the previous teams that it knows about. Each time a card is picked, the 
program will pull information from the teams it already knows about and compile
this to give the user suggestions for other cards that it should use. 

Land marks: 
	1. Have the program read in the file, treating all teams as equals when it
		decides on who should be on the team.
	2. Take into account of the win/lose ration of each team, putting the ones
		with the highest win rate to have the higher priority.
	3. provide a GUI for the program to run on.
